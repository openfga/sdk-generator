[{{appName}}]({{websiteUrl}}) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

{{appName}} is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. {{appName}}â€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

It allows in-memory data storage for quick development, as well as pluggable database modules - with initial support for PostgreSQL.

It offers an [HTTP API]({{apiDocsUrl}}) and has SDKs for programming languages including [Node.js/JavaScript](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/js-sdk), [GoLang](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/go-sdk) and [.NET](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/dotnet-sdk).

More SDKs and integrations such as Rego are planned for the future.
