This is the main generator responsible for generating the OpenFGA SDKs from the [OpenFGA OpenAPIv2 Document](https://github.com/openfga/api/blob/main/docs/openapiv2/apidocs.swagger.json).

## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
1. Git
2. Docker
3. Make (Optional, but makes things much easier)
4. curl
5. Bash
6. sed

### Usage

1. Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openfga/sdk-generator.git
```

2. Clone existing SDKs into the clients directory

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openfga/go-sdk.git clients/fga-go-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/js-sdk.git clients/fga-js-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/dotnet-sdk.git clients/fga-dotnet-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/python-sdk.git clients/fga-python-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/kotlin-sdk.git clients/fga-kotlin-sdk
```

3. Build and test the client sdks
```shell
make
```

### Adding a new SDK

#### Using the setup script
There is a helpful script to setup a new SDK

```shell
make setup-new-sdk
```

1. It will ask you for a an SDK ID, use something like: go, js, dotnet, java, etc...
2. It will ask you for a [valid generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators.md)
3. Then in will initialize all the files, you will need to add the configuration specific to that sdk
4. Now you can run `make build-client-${SDK_ID}` to generate the SDK

#### Manually

1. Create config dir in: `config/clients/{lang}/`. It should include:
   * `CHANGELOG.md`: To be updated as new releases are generated
   * `generator.txt`: the name of the generator to use. Must be a [valid generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators.md)
   * `config.overrides.json`: Custom config for this generator + overrides to the common config in `config/common/config.base.json`
   * `.openapi-generator-ignore`: Any files that the generator should ignore and not build
   * `template/` directory'
      * `LICENSE`: License file from legal. Note: All SDKs must be MIT Licensed.
      * `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: Any CI checks that need to run
      * The following files, each with the relevant section (look at the JS template for an example):
         * README_installation.mustache
         * README_initializing.mustache
         * README_calling_api.mustache
         * README_api_endpoints.mustache
         * README_models.mustache
         * README_license_disclaimer.mustache
      * custom files according to the generator
2. Update the `Makefile`.
   1. add a target for the new sdk
```makefile
.PHONY: build-client-{{LANG}}
build-client-{{LANG}}:
	make build-client sdk_language={{LANG}} tmpdir=${TMP_DIR}
	# ... any other custom build steps ...
```
   2. add it as a dependency to the `build-all-clients`
```makefile
.PHONY: build-all-clients
build-all-clients: build-client-js build-client-go ...  build-client-{{LANG}}
```
   3. add a target for the new sdk's tests that depend on the build target
```makefile
.PHONY: test-client-{{LANG}}
test-client-{{LANG}}: build-client-{{LANG}}
	# ... any custom test code ...
```
   4. add it as a dependency to the `test-all-clients`
```makefile
.PHONY: test-all-clients
test-all-clients: test-client-js test-client-go ...  test-client-{{LANG}}
```

### Uploading the SDK

Once the SDK is ready, you need to:
* Create a repo under the [openfga](https://github.com/openfga) github org. Call it: `${SDK_ID}-sdk`
* Add it to the generator's test and deploy actions
* Add any necessary secrets to the generator's repo on github (and document them in the readme)

### Publishing/Open Sourcing the SDK

Once the SDK is ready, you need to:
1. Setup Snyk, and ensure no security issues are present
2. Setup Fossa, and ensure no compliance issues are present
3. Request a review from the team

Note: Semgrep will be automatically enabled - there is nothing you need to do for that.

## Contributing
Please review the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/openfga/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a PR or opening an issue.

In addition, we ask that the SDKs:

* be generated from the [openapiv2 swagger document](https://github.com/openfga/api/blob/main/docs/openapiv2/apidocs.swagger.json) using the sdk-generator.

* have roughly the same consistent interface for configuration, such as [JS](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk), [GoLang](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), [.NET](https://github.com/openfga/dotnet-sdk) and [Python](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk) SDKs.

* support the same features with other existing SDKs.

* have a base set of functional tests.

* have no tests that talk to an external service (external calls should be disallowed and mocked).

* have building & publishing automated through GitHub actions.

* be created and modified through pull requests to this sdk-generator repository instead of individual repositories. Most of the code will be in mustache files that will end up generating the resulting SDK for the appropriate language.
