## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

1. Git
2. Docker
3. Make (Optional, but makes things much easier)
4. curl
5. Bash
6. sed

### Usage

1. Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openfga/sdk-generator.git
```

2. Clone existing SDKs into the clients directory

```shell
git clone git@github.com:openfga/go-sdk.git clients/fga-go-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/js-sdk.git clients/fga-js-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/dotnet-sdk.git clients/fga-dotnet-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/python-sdk.git clients/fga-python-sdk
git clone git@github.com:openfga/java-sdk.git clients/fga-java-sdk
```

3. Build and test the client sdks

```shell
make
```

### Adding a new SDK

#### Using the setup script

There is a helpful script to setup a new SDK

```shell
make setup-new-sdk
```

1. It will ask you for a an SDK ID, use something like: go, js, dotnet, java, etc...
2. It will ask you for a [valid generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators.md)
3. Then in will initialize all the files, you will need to add the configuration specific to that sdk
4. Now you can run `make build-client-${SDK_ID}` to generate the SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If using Colima to run docker, you must add `$TMPDIR` as a location in the `mounts` section of the [colima.yaml](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/main/embedded/defaults/colima.yaml#L185-L198) for `make build-client-${SDK_ID}` to succeed. Otherwise, the build script cannot mount the directory where the required `config.json` is created and the command will fail.

#### Manually

1. Create config dir in: `config/clients/{lang}/`. It should include:
   - `CHANGELOG.md`: To be updated as new releases are generated
   - `generator.txt`: the name of the generator to use. Must be a [valid generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators.md)
   - `config.overrides.json`: Custom config for this generator + overrides to the common config in `config/common/config.base.json`
   - `.openapi-generator-ignore`: Any files that the generator should ignore and not built
   - `template-source`: Newer SDKs should have this to mark what commit of the generator we branched off
   - `template/` directory
     - `LICENSE`: Apache-2.0 License
     - `.github/workflows/main.yml`: Any CI checks that need to run
     - The following files, each with the relevant section (look at the JS template for an example):
       - `README_installation.mustache`
       - `README_initializing.mustache`
       - `README_calling_api.mustache`
       - `README_api_endpoints.mustache`
       - `README_models.mustache`
       - `README_license_disclaimer.mustache`
       - `README_custom_badges.mustache` (optional, any custom badges for this specific SDK)
       - `gitignore_custom.mustache` (optional, any custom ignores for this specific SDK)
       - `NOTICE_details.mustache` (optional, see [Updating the Notice files](#updating-the-notice-files))
     - custom files according to the generator
2. Update the `Makefile`.
   1. add a target for the new sdk

```makefile
.PHONY: build-client-{{LANG}}
build-client-{{LANG}}:
	make build-client sdk_language={{LANG}} tmpdir=${TMP_DIR}
	# ... any other custom build steps ...
```

2.  add it as a dependency to the `build-all-clients`

```makefile
.PHONY: build-all-clients
build-all-clients: build-client-js build-client-go ...  build-client-{{LANG}}
```

3.  add a target for the new sdk's tests that depend on the build target

```makefile
.PHONY: test-client-{{LANG}}
test-client-{{LANG}}: build-client-{{LANG}}
	# ... any custom test code ...
```

4.  add it as a dependency to the `test-all-clients`

```makefile
.PHONY: test-all-clients
test-all-clients: test-client-js test-client-go ...  test-client-{{LANG}}
```

> Note: Try to ensure that the SDK is built through container files so that other contributors would not need to set up the full language framework/toolchain whenever they need to contribute. Checkout the [go sdk build steps](https://github.com/openfga/sdk-generator/blob/bf6709a5faba14ce260f4f8df019dddd54078df0/Makefile#L76) as an example.

### Updating the Notice files

1- Ensure that `fossaComplianceNoticeId` has been set in each SDK's config overrides.
2- Run `make update-fossa-reports`

### Uploading the SDK

Once the SDK is ready, you need to:

- Create a repo under the [openfga](https://github.com/openfga) github org. Call it: `${SDK_ID}-sdk`
- Add it to the generator's test and deploy actions
- Add any necessary secrets to the generator's repo on github (and document them in the readme)

### Publishing/Open Sourcing the SDK

Once the SDK is ready, you need to:

1. Setup Snyk, and ensure no security issues are present
2. Setup Fossa, and ensure no compliance issues are present
3. Request a review from the team

Note: Semgrep will be automatically enabled - there is nothing you need to do for that.

### GitHub Action Secrets

| Key             | Comment       |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| `FOSSA_API_KEY` | FOSSA API Key |
| `SNYK_TOKEN`    | Snyk API Key  |

## Contributing

Please review the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/openfga/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a PR or opening an issue.

In addition, we ask that the SDKs:

- be generated from the [openapiv2 swagger document](https://github.com/openfga/api/blob/main/docs/openapiv2/apidocs.swagger.json) using the sdk-generator.

- have roughly the same consistent interface for configuration, such as [JS](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk), [GoLang](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), [.NET](https://github.com/openfga/dotnet-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk) and [Java](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk) SDKs.

- support the same features with other existing SDKs, including: Retries, Error Handling, .

- have a base set of functional tests.

- have no tests that talk to an external service (external calls should be disallowed and mocked).

- have building & publishing automated through GitHub actions.

- be created and modified through pull requests to this sdk-generator repository instead of individual repositories. Most of the code will be in mustache files that will end up generating the resulting SDK for the appropriate language.
